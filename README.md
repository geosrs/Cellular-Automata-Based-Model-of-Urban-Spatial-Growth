# Cellular-Automata-Based-Model-of-Urban-Spatial-Growth


Modelling and Simulation Course - Developed a cellular-automata based model for simulating future urban growth of a region (Ahmedabad District) and emphasized the conditions under which spontaneous growth, such as that which characterized the regeneration of inner cities and the location of edge cities, could be modelled. My role was to write the code in Java and output a figure depicting future urban growth prediction of a city/region.
